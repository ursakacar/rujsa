Miss Watermelon, Miss Watermelon and Miss Watermelon. Every Saturday afternoon they go for a stroll in the park and they always stop to feed the ducks. Every Tuesday and Thursday they all gather at Miss' Watermelon for coffee and cakes and a healthy dose of gossip. Miss Watermelon likes her coffee black, but the other two take it with milk. They are much less picky when it comes to cakes and gossip.
