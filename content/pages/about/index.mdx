##### Who are you?

I am really glad you asked, because I would have told you anyway. You've definitely spared us some awkwardness.

Ruj≈°a is the name under which I create semi-pretty things out of airdry clay. I am otherwise a very uninteresting person who is being paid to sit in front of the computer all day, which is why I set out to find a hobby that had nothing to do with electronics.

##### Are you selling?

Not actively. Clay stuff is my seventh hobby (in terms of importance), meaning it gets very little of my attention. And selling products requires a lot of attention, if you want to do it properly, and I would want to do it properly, if I were to do it. For the same reason I also don't accept custom orders. It usually takes me a month to complete a batch (molding, sanding, painting, polishing) and ain't nobody gonna wait for that!

With that said, if you really, really, _really_ like something you see, just shoot me a message and we can try to figure something out.

##### Then why does this page even exist?

I understand there seems to be no apparent reason for this page to exist, but there actually is one. I wanted to have a page, so I made it.

##### What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

African or european swallow?

##### European.

About 24 miles per hour or 11 meters per second.

##### Thank you for your time!

Thank you, I really enjoyed talking to myself.
